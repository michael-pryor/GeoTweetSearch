# GeoTweetSearch
Spatio-temporal Analysis of Twitter Data Streams

I plan to set this running long term on a server in the near future.

This was originally coded as part of a University project; the report for this can be found here:

This project was originally in SVN and was not migrated properly, hence the lack of commit history.
