# GeoTweetSearch
This project is running at: https://www.geotweetsearch.org.

Big data system for analysing large quantities of real time and historical data from Twitter. The system is capable of handling hundreds of thousands of tweets per hour with a data collection containing millions of Twitter tweets and users. The system is written in Python; it has a MongoDB database back end and a web based front end built using JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap technologies.

This project was originally in SVN and was not migrated properly, hence the lack of commit history.
